				<p>Neuralink is an American neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk and eight others, reported to be developing implantable brainâ€“computer interfaces (BCIs). The company's headquarters are in San Francisco; it was started in 2016 and was first publicly reported in March 2017. The trademark "Neuralink" was purchased from its previous owners in January 2017.</p>
				<p>Wait But Why reported in April 2017 that Musk said the company aims to make devices to treat serious brain diseases in the short-term, with the eventual goal of human enhancement. In June 2016, Musk discussed a science fiction concept called "neural lace" that is part of the fictional universe in The Culture, a series of novels by Iain M. Banks.</p>
